# StainGAN
StainGAN implementation based on Cycle-Consistency Concept

For more information visit website.

This implementation is ZMMK adapted fork. Some of the original features, for example visualization, were deemed unnecessary at the moment.
Further improvement of this repository should include some customized metrics and logging.

## Structure
 * Stain-Transfer Model
 * Pre-processing.
 * Post-processing.
 * Evaluation 

## Datasets

The evaluation was done using the Camelyon16 challenge (https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/) consisting of 400 whole-slide images collected
in two different labs in Radboud University Medical Center (lab 1) and University
Medical Center Utrecht (lab 2). Otsu thresholding was used to remove the
background, Afterwards, 40, 000 256 Ã— 256 patches were generated on the x40
magnification level, 30, 000 were used for training and 10, 000 used for validation
from lab 1 and 10, 000 patches were generated for testing from lab 2.
